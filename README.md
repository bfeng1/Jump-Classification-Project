- 👋 Hi, I’m @bfeng1
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, artificial intellegence 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning electrical and computer engineer in university of memphis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D marker-less gait analysis system
- 📫 How to reach me: binfengmemphis@gmail.com

Main purpose of this project:
Use gathed kinematical infomation duing vertical jump to determine if the jump style is good or bad.

Dataset:
csv_files\lable.csv: 
labels for each jump(good or bad)
csv_files\good*.csv: 
normal jump cycles. It contains timeseries data with five different features, such as left knee angle, left ankle angle, right knee angle, right ankle angle and left knee angle ratio(left knee angle / left ankle angle)
csv_files\inner*.csv: 
bad jump cycles with knee going inner side. It contains timeseries data with five different features, such as left knee angle, left ankle angle, right knee angle, right ankle angle and left knee angle ratio(left knee angle / left ankle angle)
csv_files\outer*.csv: 
bad jump cycles with knee going outer side. It contains timeseries data with five different features, such as left knee angle, left ankle angle, right knee angle, right ankle angle and left knee angle ratio(left knee angle / left ankle angle)
